Free, simple and secure token-based authentication for your WordPress. No registration required.

== Description ==

= Secure your WordPress Administration area with 2FAS Prime plugin =

The 2FAS Prime plugin is a free, simple and very easy to set up WordPress plugin. It guarantees a completely secure login to your WordPress website. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA), the best protection against weak passwords, automated password guessing and brute force attacks.
2FA Prime plugin provides two-factor authentication whenever you log in to the WordPress website ensuring no unauthorised access to it. If you log in as an admin from an untrusted device, you will be requested to provide additional authentication in the form of a one-time token.
2FAS plugin works perfectly with 2FAS Authenticator app  but supports also other 2FA apps based on TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password).

= Install & use =

You do not need to register, create a special account, log in or take any other additional action to use the 2FAS Prime plugin. All you need to have is 2FA and all you need to do is install plugin and activate it in your WordPress. It is as simple as that. Moreover, the 2FAS Prime plugin does not communicate with any external sites. All data needed to make the plugin work properly are safely stored in the WordPress database.

= Free for all users =

2FAS’s Two Factor Authentication is available to all users. All you need to do is to install it and configure. It is FREE for all users.

= Get instant protection against: =

= Brute-force attacks =

It happens that the encrypted password for the portal is hacked due to outdated software or plugins. It is only a matter of time before the encoded hash password will be decrypted and will appear online. You don’t have to worry about it if you use the 2FAS Prime plugin. Even if the attacker knows your password, he still has to enter the one-time token generated by 2FAS App to gain access to your account.

= WordPress takeovers =

Many people use the same password or a similar password for many online services. ‘Weak’ and repeatedly used passwords remain a major cybersecurity vulnerability. You effectively reduce that risk when you carefully choose your passwords and enable Two Factor Authentication with the 2FAS Prime plugin.

= Phishing and keylogger attacks =

Enable the 2FAS Prime to protect your WordPress site and make sure that the devices used by you or other users are completely free of keyloggers and viruses.
Any password discovery attempt is useless with 2FAS. Without your token generated by the 2FAS app or other 2FA app, conventional access to your WordPress site is almost impossible.
