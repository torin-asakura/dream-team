# WPGraphQL Polylang Extension

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/valu-digital/wp-graphql-polylang.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/valu-digital/wp-graphql-polylang)

Extend [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) schema with language data from
the [Polylang](https://polylang.pro/) plugin.

## Features

For posts and terms (custom ones too!)

-   Adds `language` and `translations` fields
-   Filter with a `language` where argument
-   Set the language on create and update mutations
-   Show all translations in the api by default
    -   Polylang patches the WP Query to only list items with the current
        default language. This plugin reverts that for the GraphQL api
-   ACF Options Pages support

Root queries

-   `defaultLanguage` get the current default language
-   `languages` list all configured languages

Menu

-   Filter menu items by language

For details please refer to the generated docs in GraphiQL.

## Example

Example showing all features

```graphql
query PolylangExample {
    # Filter pages by language. If not set it defaults to ALL
    pages(where: { language: EN }) {
        nodes {
            title

            # Get language of each page
            language {
                code # Language code
                name # Human readable name of the language
            }

            # Get links to the translates versions of each page
            # This is an array of post objects
            translations {
                title
                link
                language {
                    code
                }
            }
        }
    }

    # Taxonomies such as tags can be filtered like post objects
    tags(where: { language: EN }) {
        nodes {
            name
            language {
                code
                name
            }
        }
    }

    # Get translated version of a given menu
    menuItems(where: { language: EN, location: FOOTER_MENU }) {
        nodes {
            url
        }
    }

    # Get the default language
    defaultLanguage {
        name
        code
    }

    # Get all configured languages
    languages {
        name
        code
    }

    # Get translations for ACF Options Pages.
    # See the section in the README.
    siteSettings(language: EN) {
        siteSettings {
            footerTitle
        }
    }
}
```

## Requirements

-   PHP 7.2. We're planning to relax this a bit though
-   [WPGraphQL][] 0.6.x or later
-   Polylang 2.6.5 or later
    -   The free version is enough
    -   If you get the PRO version the pro features such as translated slugs will work too

## Installation

If you use composer you can install it from Packagist

    composer require valu/wp-graphql-polylang

Otherwise you can clone it from Github to your plugins using the stable branch

    cd wp-content/plugins
    git clone --branch stable https://github.com/valu-digital/wp-graphql-polylang.git

## ACF Options Pages

In addition to WPGraphQL and Polylang plugins you'll need these plugins too

-   [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
    -   It's Pro only feature
-   [ACF Options For Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-options-for-polylang/)
-   [WPGraphQL for Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.wpgraphql.com/acf/)
    -   v0.3.2 or later is required

You can install the free plugins using Composer. You'll need to have the
[WordPress Packagist][] repository enabled.

```
composer require wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf wpackagist-plugin/acf-options-for-polylang
```

When registering the Options Page you must pass in `show_in_graphql` and
`graphql_field_name` arguments.

```php
acf_add_options_page([
    'page_title' => __('Site settings', 'theme'),
    'menu_title' => __('Site settings', 'theme'),
    'menu_slug' => 'site-settings',
    'capability' => 'manage_options',
    'redirect' => false,
    'show_in_graphql' => true,
    'graphql_field_name' => 'siteSettings'
]);
```
